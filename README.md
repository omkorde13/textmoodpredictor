🧠 Mental Stress Detector — NLP & Machine Learning Pipeline

A machine learning-powered mental stress detection system that analyzes text data (e.g., journal entries, social media posts, or survey responses) to predict levels of stress — Low, Medium, or High.
It uses NLP preprocessing, TF-IDF feature extraction, and multiple ML algorithms (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, etc.) to identify stress patterns in written language.
